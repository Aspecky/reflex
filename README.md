## ‚ôªÔ∏è Reflex

**Reflex** is a simple state container inspired by [Rodux](https://github.com/roblox/rodux) and [Silo](https://github.com/sleitnick/rbxts-silo), designed to be an all-in-one solution for managing and reacting to state in Roblox games.

You can use Reflex with Roact on the client, or to manage your game's state on the server.

&nbsp;

## üì¶ Installation

This package is only available for Roblox TypeScript on NPM:

```bash
npm install @rbxts/reflex
```

```bash
pnpm add @rbxts/reflex
```

&nbsp;

## üìö Documentation

### üéÇ Producers

**Producers** are state containers that combine methods to observe your state, and callbacks that change your state.

**`createProducer()`** takes an initial state and a table of action callbacks, and returns a producer. Similar to Rodux, state is immutable, and must be modified by returning a new state object.

```ts
const myProducer = createProducer({ count: 0 } satisfies State, {
	increment: (state) => ({ ...state, count: state.count + 1 }),
	decrement: (state) => ({ ...state, count: state.count - 1 }),
	set: (state, count: number) => ({ ...state, count }),
});

myProducer.getState(); // { count: 0 }
myProducer.increment(); // { count: 1 }
```

### üç∞ Selectors

**Selectors** are functions that take a state and return a value. They can be used to observe a subset of your state, or to derive a value from your state. Producers provide a `select` method that simplifies getting a piece of state.

Note that when deriving state, or performing an expensive calculation, it's best to memoize your selectors to prevent excessive recalculations. Reflex provides a `createSelector` function that memoizes selectors for you.

```ts
const selectCount = (state: State) => state.count;

const selectWord = createSelector([selectCount] as const, (count) => {
	return "E".rep(count);
});

myProducer.set(10);
myProducer.select(selectWord); // "EEEEEEEEEE"
```

You might also have a selector that depends on parameters from outside of your state. In that case, you can use this pattern:

```ts
const createSelectWord = (word: string) => {
	return createSelector([selectCount] as const, (count) => {
		return word.rep(count);
	});
};
```

### üîÆ Observing state

You can observe changes to subsets of your state with selectors using the `observe`, `once`, and `wait` methods. Additionally, the `subscribe` method allows you to observe changes to the entire state.

When a dispatcher is called, the observers are scheduled to run on the next frame with the new state, so you can safely call multiple dispatchers in a single frame.

```ts
const unsubscribe = myProducer.observe(selectCount, (count, prevCount) => {
	print(`Count changed from ${prevCount} to ${count}`);
});

for (const _ of $range(1, 10)) {
	myProducer.increment();
}

unsubscribe();
```

```ts
// Count changed from 0 to 10
```

### üñ•Ô∏è Managing multiple producers

Similar to Rodux, Reflex allows you to organize your state into multiple producers, and then combining them into a single producer to be used in your game.

The `combineProducers()` function takes a table of producers, and returns a new producer that combines the states and dispatchers. Any dispatchers called in the combined producer will be forwarded to every producer in the table.

> **Warning**
> Dispatchers called on individual producers will not be tracked by the combined producer!
> To dispatch an action on a combined producer, you must call it through the combined producer.

```ts
const producerA = createProducer({ count: 0 } satisfies StateA, {
	shared: (state) => ({ ...state, count: state.count + 1 }),
	privateA: (state) => ({ ...state, count: state.count + 1 }),
});

const producerB = createProducer({ count: 0 } satisfies StateB, {
	shared: (state) => ({ ...state, count: state.count + 1 }),
	privateB: (state) => ({ ...state, count: state.count + 1 }),
});

const combinedProducer = combineProducers({
	a: producerA,
	b: producerB,
});

combinedProducer.shared(); // { a: { count: 1 }, b: { count: 1 } }
combinedProducer.privateA(); // { ..., a: { count: 2 } }
combinedProducer.privateB(); // { ..., b: { count: 2 } }
```

### ‚öõÔ∏è Roact

Reflex offers native support for [`@rbxts/roact-hooked`](https://npmjs.com/package/@rbxts/roact-hooked) with the `useSelector()` and `useProducer<Producer>()` hooks. Using them requires setting up a `ReflexProvider` at the root of your Roact tree.

If you don't want to use the generic type, Reflex exports the `UseSelectorHook` and `UseProducerHook` types to make narrowing the type easier.

```tsx
// use-app-producer.ts
export const useAppProducer: UseSelectorHook<AppProducer> = useProducer;
```

```tsx
// App.tsx
export default function App() {
	const { increment, decrement } = useAppProducer();
	const count = useSelector(selectCount);

	return (
		<textbutton
			Text={`Count: ${count}`}
			AnchorPoint={new Vector2(0.5, 0.5)}
			Size={new UDim2(0, 100, 0, 50)}
			Position={new UDim2(0.5, 0, 0.5, 0)}
			Event={{
				Activated: increment,
				MouseButton2Click: decrement,
			}}
		/>
	);
}
```

```tsx
// main.client.tsx
Roact.mount(
	<ReflexProvider producer={myProducer}>
		<App />
	</ReflexProvider>,
);
```

For memoizing selectors that depend on parameters, you can use the `useSelectorCreator()` hook to memoize the returned selector and prevent unnecessary re-renders.

```tsx
const createSelectWord = (word: string) => {
	return createSelector([selectCount] as const, (count) => {
		return word.rep(count);
	});
};
```

```ts
const word = useSelectorCreator(createSelectWord, "E");
```

## üöß Roadmap

This project is still in early development, and is missing some features that I plan to add in the future:

-   [ ] Middleware
-   [ ] Logging
-   [ ] Standardized server-to-client syncing
-   [ ] No `as const` requirement for createSelector
